# TCA-SwiftData

A simple practice project combining SwiftUI, SwiftData, and TCA to demonstrate state management and data handling.

## Overview

This project is a practical example that integrates three powerful frameworks in the Swift ecosystem:
- **SwiftUI**: A declarative framework for building user interfaces.
- **SwiftData**: A data management framework.
- **TCA (The Composable Architecture)**: A library for building applications in a consistent and understandable way, with a focus on composition, testing, and ergonomics.

## Features

- **State Management**: Utilizing TCA for predictable and testable state management.
- **Data Handling**: Managing data with SwiftData.
- **User Interface**: Building responsive and interactive UIs with SwiftUI.
